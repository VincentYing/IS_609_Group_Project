## Problem Definition



### Project 5.3.3 (page 201): Craps Monte Carlo Simulation


Craps - Construct and perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the popular casino game of craps. The rules are as follows:      
      
There are two basic bets in craps, pass and don't pass. In the pass bet, you wager that the shooter (the person throwing the dice) will win; in the don't pass bet, you wager that the shooter will lose. We will play by the rule that on an initial roll of 12 ("boxcars"), both pass and don't pass bets are losers. Both are even-money bets.      
      
Conduct of the game:  

  - Roll a 7 or 11 on the first roll: Shooter wins (pass bets win and don't pass bets lose).  
  - Roll a 12 on the first roll: Shooter loses (boxcars; pass and don't pass bets lose).  
  - Roll a 2 or 3 on the first roll: Shooter loses (pass bets lose, don't pass bets win).   
  - Roll 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 on the first roll: This becomes the point. The object then becomes to roll the point again before rolling a 7.     
  - The shooter continues to roll the dice until the point or a 7 appears. Pass bettors win if the shooter rolls the point again before rolling a 7. Don't pass bettors win if the shooter rolls a 7 before rolling the point again.  

![Overview key](Craps.png)      
      
Write an algorithm and code it in the computer language of your choice. Run the simulation to estimate the probability of winning a pass bet and the probability of winning a don't pass bet. Which is the better bet? As the number of trials increases, to what do the probabilities converge?

\pagebreak

## Solution - Mathematical Approach
      
Craps involves the rolling of two dice. The assumption is that the dice are fair and the outcomes of the various rolls are independent.    

### Simple Mathematics
      
The possible totals obtained from rolling two dice are as below:

&nbsp;|&nbsp;|1 |	2 |	3 |	4 |	5 |	6
--|--|----|---|---|---|---|---
1	|&nbsp;|2 |	3 |	4 |	5 |	6 |	7 
2	|&nbsp;|3 |	4 |	5 |	6 |	7 |	8 
3	|&nbsp;|4 |	5 |	6 |	7 |	8 |	9 
4	|&nbsp;|5 |	6 |	7 |	8 |	9 |	10 
5	|&nbsp;|6 |	7 |	8 |	9 |	10|	11 
6	|&nbsp;|7 |	8 |	9 |	10|	11|	12 

<P>
      
Now let us examine the rules:   

- Roll a 7 or 11 on the first roll ("natural"): Shooter wins    
     Now the probability of getting 7 or 11 is $\frac{8}{36}$, or about `r round(800/36,2)`&#37;.    

- Roll a 2 or 3 or 12 on the first roll ("craps"): Shooter loses    
     The probability of getting 2 or 3 or 12 is $\frac{4}{36}$, or about `r round(400/36,2)`&#37;.

- Roll 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 on the first roll: This becomes the point. The Shooter's goal then becomes to roll the point again before rolling a 7        
     The probability of rolling 4 is $\frac{3}{36}$. Once Shooter has rolled the 4, the only cells that matter are the cells containing 4 and 7. All other cells can be ignored. There are 9 cells containing 4 or 7 of which only 3 cells are favorable to Shooter. Hence the probability of Shooter rolling another 4 before a 7 is $\frac{3}{9}$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 4, and then rolling a 4 before a 7 is $\frac{3}{36} \times \frac{3}{9}$ or about `r round(3/36*3/9*100,2)`&#37;.      
     Table below summarizes the winning probabilities of Shooter in craps:

Initial Roll  | Probability of Winning |	Probability in Decimal
------ | ------------ | ---------- 
4 |	$\frac{3}{36} \times \frac{3}{9}$	 | `r 3/36*3/9`
5	| $\frac{4}{36} \times \frac{4}{10}$ | `r 4/36*4/10`
6	| $\frac{5}{36} \times \frac{5}{11}$ | `r 5/36*5/11`
7	| $\frac{6}{36}$ |	`r 6/36`
8	| $\frac{5}{36} \times \frac{5}{11}$ | `r 5/36*5/11`
9	| $\frac{4}{36} \times \frac{4}{10}$ | `r 4/36*4/10`
10|	$\frac{3}{36} \times \frac{3}{9}$	 | `r 3/36*3/9`
11|	$\frac{2}{36}$ |	`r 2/36`
&nbsp;| **Total** |	**`r 3/36*3/9*2 + 4/36*4/10*2 + 5/36*5/11*2 + 6/36 + 2/36`**

<P>
      
### More Mathematical
      
Let $P(p = n)$ is the probability of rolling a total $n$. For rolls that are not naturals (7 or 11, say W) or craps (2 or 3 or 12, say L), the probability that the point $p = n$ will be rolled before 7 is found from
      
$P(win \mid p = n) = \frac{P(p = n)}{P(p = 7)+P(p = n))} = \frac{P(p = n)}{\frac{1}{6}+P(p = n)}$
      
      
Applying the above, we get the same result as above:      
      
Initial Roll ($n$) | $P(p = n)$ | $P(win \mid p = n)$ | $P(win) = P(p = n) P(win \mid p = n)$ | Probability in Decimal
---------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------
2 | $\frac{1}{36}$	| 0	| 0	| 0
3 | $\frac{2}{36}$	| 0	| 0	| 0
4	| $\frac{3}{36}$	| $\frac{3}{9}$	| $\frac{3}{36} \times \frac{3}{9}$	| `r 3/36*3/9` 
5	| $\frac{4}{36}$	| $\frac{4}{10}$|	$\frac{4}{36} \times \frac{4}{10}$|	`r 4/36*4/10` 
6	| $\frac{5}{36}$	| $\frac{5}{11}$|	$\frac{5}{36} \times \frac{5}{11}$|	`r 5/36*5/11`
7	| $\frac{6}{36}$	| 1	| $\frac{6}{36}$	| `r 6/36` 
8	| $\frac{5}{36}$	| $\frac{5}{11}$|	$\frac{5}{36} \times \frac{5}{11}$|	`r 5/36*5/11` 
9	| $\frac{4}{36}$	| $\frac{4}{10}$|	$\frac{4}{36} \times \frac{4}{10}$|	`r 4/36*4/10` 
10|	$\frac{3}{36}$	| $\frac{3}{9}$|	$\frac{3}{36} \times \frac{3}{9}$ |	`r 3/36*3/9` 
11|	$\frac{2}{36}$	| 1	| $\frac{2}{36}$	| `r 2/36` 
12|	$\frac{1}{36}$	| 0	| 0	| 0

```{r calc1, echo=FALSE}
win <- 3/36*3/9*2 + 4/36*4/10*2 + 5/36*5/11*2 + 6/36 + 2/36
```
Hence, $P(win) = \sum_{n=2}^{12} P(p = n) P(win \mid p = n)$ = `r win` 


Hence the probability of the Shooter wins = `r round(win*100,2)`&#37;
      
Which implies the probability that the Shooter loses = `r round((1 - win)*100,2)`&#37;
      
**Note**: *We will see the same results in our decision tree model while solve this Craps game*.

### Back to Craps Problem
      
Here we have 2 types of bets - Pass and Don't Pass. In the Pass bet, the gambler wins only when Shooter wins and in Don't Pass bet the gambler wins only when Shooters loses except the Boxcars (Roll a 12 on the first roll).      
        
Hence, for the **_Pass bet gambler_**, the winning probability is:  `r round(win*100,2)`&#37;     
And for the Casino (or house), the winning probability is:  `r round((1 - win)*100,2)`&#37;      
Thus, _the house has an advantage of about 1.4% on any Pass bet_.
        
```{r calc2, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(bins=c(runif(1,0,1)))
for (i in 1:(round(win,3)*1000)) {
  df <- rbind(df, data.frame(bins=c(1)))
}
for (i in 1:((1-round(win,3)-round(1/36,3))*1000-1)) {
  df <- rbind(df, data.frame(bins=c(runif(1,-2,-1))))
}
for (i in 1:(round(1/36,3)*1000)) {
  df <- rbind(df, data.frame(bins=c(runif(1,-1,0))))
}
# cat("Graphical representation of Shooter's Lose/Win:\n")
hist(df$bins, breaks=1.5, col=c("red","green"), main="", xlab="Casino (Red) / Pass bet Gambler (Green)", ylab="Frequency x 1000")
```
        
Now the probability of Boxcars = $\frac{1}{36}$ = `r round(100/36,2)`&#37;      
          
          
Hence, for **_Don't Pass bet gambler_**,
        
        
Event  | Probability
---------------  | ----------------------
TIE on Don't Pass bet	| $\frac{1}{36}$ = `r 1/36` = `r round(100/36,2)`&#37;
WIN on Don't Pass bet	| `r (1 - win)` - $\frac{1}{36}$ = `r (1-win-1/36)` = `r round((1-win-1/36)*100,2)`&#37;
LOSE on Don't Pass bet	| 1 - $\frac{1}{36}$ - `r (1-win-1/36)` = `r win` = `r round(win*100,2)`&#37;


Hence, mathematically we can say that for a particularly game, the winning probability of

* Pass bets: `r round(win*100,2)`&#37;
* Don't Pass bets: `r round((1-win-1/36)*100,2)`&#37;
* Boxcars (both Pass and Don't Pass bets lose): `r round(100/36,2)`&#37;        
        
        
```{r calc3, echo=FALSE}
# cat("Graphical representation of Pass / Don't Pass Win:\n")
boundaries <- seq(-2, 1, by=1);
colors = c("red", "yellow", "green")
hist(df$bins, breaks=boundaries, col=colors, main="", xlab="Don't Pass Win (Red) / All Lose (Yellow) / Pass Win (Green)", ylab="Frequency x 1000")
````
        
          
### Mathematical Conclusion
      
      
      
The casino has only a slight edge in craps. But, in the long run, the game is a money-maker for the casino since the casino plays on indefinitely. While in Pass bet scenario house is always in advantage, we need to analyze Don't Pass bet bit more.      

Since on the tie or Boxcars nobody wins, let us ignore that situation. If we reduce this to a win or lose situation, the probability that a Don't Pass Bet wins is $\frac{0.479293}{(0.479293 + 0.492929)}$ = 0.492987 and the probability that a Don't Pass Bet loses is 1 - 0.492987 = 0.507013. Thus the casino maintains a 1.4&#37; advantage over the player even in Don't Pass bet.

If we repeat this simulation of the pass bets $1000$ times:
```{r pass, echo = FALSE}
PassBets <- replicate(1000, {

N = 1000

data = {}

for (i in 1:N){
  stop = FALSE
  
  shooter = sample(1:6,1) + sample (1:6,1)
  
  if (shooter == 12){
    data[i] = 0
    stop = TRUE
  }
  
  else if ((shooter == 7)||(shooter==11)){

We see that the probabilities are generally below 50%

      data[i]=1
      stop = TRUE
    }
    
    else{

      shooter = sample(1:6,1) + sample (1:6,1)
      
      if (shooter == 7){
        data[i]=1
        stop = TRUE
      }
      else if (shooter == point){
        data[i]=0
        stop = TRUE
      }
    }
  }
  
  #Probability of winning when you are a no-pass bet

```
      


Note that no matter the choice, the odds are usually worse than a coin-flip

\pagebreak

### Decision tree with expected value of winning
      
![Overview key](Tree.png)      

From the decision tree, we can see that the Probability of Shooter's wining = 49.29&#37;
        
**Note**: *This is the same result we received while solveing this game mathematically*.

## Conclusion

From both mathematical analysis and simulation game, it is clear that the Craps game is close to a fair gamble where the chance for wining is very close to 50&#37;.   However, as it is less than 50&#37; and as the House will play on indefinitely, it will always come out ahead due to this slight imbalance.

## Simulating a real life situation
        
        
**[This is in addition to what this Project asked]**
        
Let us simulate a board (game) with the following assumptions:

- Simulation period: 90 days
- Each day      
      + 15 gamblers play on each day and no one will quit in betweeen a game      
      + Each will play for $50 and bet anything between $0 (not playing that round) and $5 in each shoot/round      
      + A player will quit the table only if (s)he loses $50 with which (s)he entered in Casino or game ends      
      + Each player's choice on Pass bet or Don't Pass bet will be assigned randomly (though in reality each player plays with some strategy)      
      + The game will end when less than 10% or only 1 gambler (whichever is greater) is at table     
      + The game will also end in 3 hours even if all players are playing     
      + Assume each shoot/dice throw takes 10 seconds and there is 2 minutes gap between 2 games

Below are the results of 1 day game, where

- Player: Player Number, Player 0 is Casino
- IniDolr: Initial Amount at the begining of the day
- WinDolr: Total Win Amount (negative means lose)
- BalDolr: Balance Amount at the end of the game
        
```{r rdata, echo=FALSE}
head(sim,N)
```
        
        
Total Wining Amount for all players including Casino = SUM(WinDolr) = $ `r sum(sim$WinDolr)`, implies that this is a zero sum game.
        
        
Total Amount made by Casino in `r D` days = $ `r format(sum(sim[sim$Player==0,4]), digits=10, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")`, implies longer the game, more profitable for Casino.
