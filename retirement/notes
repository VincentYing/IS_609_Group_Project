SSA BENEFIT:
- Benefit calculation involves three steps:
	1. Worker's previous earnings are recalulated in current terms with inflation adjustment.
	2. Earnings for the highest 35 years are averaged and divided by 12 to obtain AIME (Averaged Indexed Monthly Earnings).
	3. SSA benefit formula applied to AIME to obtain PIA (Primary Insurance Amount).

- PIA formula with FRA at 2015:
	(a) 90 percent of the first $826 of his/her average indexed monthly earnings, plus 
	(b) 32 percent of his/her average indexed monthly earnings over $826 and through $4,980, plus 
	(c) 15 percent of his/her average indexed monthly earnings over $4,980.

- Benefit payouts are adjusted for inflation according to CPI.
- Spousal benefit can also be claimed.
- Taxation of SSA benefits can occur when withdrawing a large amount from IRA due to RMD at 70.5 ("tax torpedo").
